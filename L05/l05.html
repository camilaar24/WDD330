    <h2>Ch13: AJAX</h2>  
    <hr size="3" color="grey">
        <p>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It's a set of web development approaches that allow web applications to work asynchronously, processing server requests in the background. The system is made up of the following components:</p>
        <li>The main language is HTML/XHTML, while the presentation is CSS.</li>
        <li>The Document Object Model (DOM) is used to show dynamic data and interact with it.</li>
        <li>For data interchange, XML is used, and for data processing, XSLT is used. </li>
        <li>For asynchronous communication, use the XMLHttpRequest object. </li>
        <li>Finally, all of these technologies are linked through the JavaScript programming language.</li>
        <p>Google's autocompleting tool is a great example of how AJAX can be used; it lets you fill in your terms as you type them. The keywords change in real-time, yet the website remains unchanged. When the internet was less evolved in the early 1990s, the same feature required Google to reload the page every time a new recommendation appeared on your screen. AJAX allows the data interchange layer and the display layer to run in parallel without interfering.</p>

        <p>HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response. 

            The Fetch API introduced a Headers interface, which can be used to create a Headers object, which can then be added as a property of Request and Response objects.
            
            Example: const headers = new Headers();</p>
    <p>A FormData an instance is created using a constructor function:</p>
    <i>const data = new FormData();
    </i>
    <p>Itâ€™s also possible to add data to the form data instance as key-value pairs using the append() method:</p>
    <i>data = new FormData(); // no form provided as an argument creates an empty form data instance
        data.append('height', 75)</i>
