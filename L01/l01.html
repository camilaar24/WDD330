    <h2>Syllabus</h2>  
    <hr size="3" color="grey">
        <ul>
          <li>Reading assignments: ~2hrs </li>
          <li>Team & individual activities: ~4-6hrs</li>
          <li>Trello cards: ~3hrs</li>
          <li>The professor led instruction: ~1hr (recorded weekly office hour</li>
          </ul>
    <p>We will spend the first 4.5 weeks of the course in teams working on a project modeled off of real-world projects. 

        For weeks 5-7 of the course you will further apply what you have learned by designing and completing a project of your choosing. This project will be with your team.</p>
    <h2>Working with Groups</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
    <p>When you're in a group, you'll have to prioritize it. Make time whenever you can to avoid disappointing your group. When working in a group, it's critical to communicate and assign duties. It is critical that each member is committed to meeting deadlines and doing his or her best to contribute to the group as an individual.

        I'm familiarized with Slack and Github but Trello is pretty much new for me, is it mandatory to use Trello for this class? If so, I'll need to start getting familiarized with Trello.

        <h2>Managing the Modern Frontend Workflow</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
    <p>Package managers are programs that keep track of all of our app's external dependencies. This includes any development tools or libraries that we may use. It not only knows which packages to download, but it also keeps track of their versions. For our package manager, we use npm.

        Bundlers are responsible for the compilation, translation, concatenation, minification, and movement of assets in our project. As a bundler, we're utilizing Snowpack. Parcel and Webpack are two other popular bundlers.
        
        Task managers keep track of what has to be done and when it needs to be done. In most cases, scripts will be defined in the task management for each development phase. We're using npm again for task management because our project is quite straightforward.
        
        </p> 
        
        <h2>Course Setup </h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
    <p>I'm having trouble installing Node, NPM and SASS

        When I type: nvm install --lts, I get this: zsh: command not found: nvm
        
        When I type: npm install -g sass  I get this: zsh: command not found: npm        
        </p> 

        <h2>Git it Together</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
    <p>Git is a tool that performs a function of code version control in a distributed way, of which several features stand out, such as:

        <li>Quick branch management, because Git predicts that a change would be merged far more frequently than it was originally planned.</li>
        
        <li>Distributed management; Changes are imported as extra branches, which can be merged in the same way that the local branch can.</li>
        
        <li>Project management that is effective.</li>
        
        <li>Package replenishing on a regular basis.</li>
        
        There are two types of Version Control Systems, Centralized and Distributed.
        
        Centralized Version Control Systems (VCS), such as Subversion, which is a tool that has been trusted to house version revision history, is a centralized point, which can lead to a loss of work if we lose network connectivity.
        
        Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) get around this problem. Some examples of distributed systems, apart from Git, are Mercurial, Bazaar, or Darcs. In these types of tools, clients fully replicate the repository.
