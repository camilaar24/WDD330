    <h2>Ch10: Testing and Debugging</h2>  
    <hr size="3" color="grey">
        <p>It was fun to learn more about debugging because I have a toxic relationship with debugging, I like it a lot but it took a long time to do it, and right now with so many classes and my job I don't have much time for debugging, so learning about feature detection by using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method. I also learned about the alert() method, the alert() method is used to display an alert box in the browser window with some message or warning. We can use it as a message or as a warning to the user.</p>
     

    <h2>How Single-Page Applications Work</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
    <p>
        SPAs are pages that are always served from the same file, that is, they have to be downloaded before they can be executed. This has an improvement in terms of user experience since the user has the feeling of navigating between pages very quickly.

        <h2>The Problem with Single Page Apps</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
    <p>
        A SPA does not have pages, it has views, and although we see that the URL changes, this is not really the case, since everything is served from the same page.
        </p>

        <p>This means that today, indexing robots, such as Google's, have problems executing them, since they are not able to do it correctly and display all the HTML content, so they are not able to understand it and index them correctly.</p>
       <p>These types of pages are always executed on the client-side, with their good and negative things, since they improve the user experience, but, in the case of having a slow connection, downloading that page to access it can be a bit more tedious.</p>

       <h2>HTML5 Template Element</h2>  
       <hr size="3" color="grey">
   <p>
    An HTML template is used as the basis for creating multiple pages with a similar layout but different content. A webmaster can design their own website templates and then distribute them to contributors for use in HTML page design. 
       </p>

       <p>"Because DocumentFragment works almost the same as the DOM, you can inject HTML5 templates into other HTML5 templates. For example, the function above could easily be extended to instead accept a DocumentFragment instance for the modal body, which could itself be created from another HTML template."</p>
