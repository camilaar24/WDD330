    <h2>Master Mobile UX </h2>  
    <hr size="3" color="grey">
        <p>"A lot of people don't know what they want until you show it to them"  -Steve Jobs</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be there when they need you (clients, users)</li>
          <li>Be useful, don't make users hunt for what they want</li>
          <li>Be quick, "the more you make them think about, the less happy they (users) will be</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ensure you make it as simple as possible for the users: placement, understanding, perception.  </p>
    
    <h2>Working with Groups</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
    <p>When you're in a group, you'll have to prioritize it. Make time whenever you can to avoid disappointing your group. When working in a group, it's critical to communicate and assign duties. It is critical that each member is committed to meeting deadlines and doing his or her best to contribute to the group as an individual.

        I'm familiarized with Slack and Github but Trello is pretty much new for me, is it mandatory to use Trello for this class? If so, I'll need to start getting familiarized with Trello.

        <h2>Ch12: Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript.</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
        <p>
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm, that is, a model or programming style that gives us guidelines on how to work with it. It is based on the concept of classes and objects. This type of programming is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (classes) to create individual instances of objects.
        </p> 
        <i>Public and Private Methods</i>
        <p>Private: The private access modifier specifies fields and methods of a class that are not accessible outside the unit where the class is declared.</p>
        <p>Public: The public access modifier denotes fields and methods that are freely accessible from any other part of a program.</p>
        
        <h2>Object Methods, "This" / This in JavaScript</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
    <p>The this keyword behaves differently in Javascript than in other languages, but in general, its value refers to the owner of the function that is calling it or, failing that, to the object where said function is a method.
        </p> 
        <p>In Javascript, there are several ways to call functions from our code; specifically, we can list up to five different ones. The choice of one or the other responds to the flow of our program but basically, they differ in the context that we want to apply to each one. Or what is the same, as the value that we want the function to assign to the this reference</p>
        <p>In modern application development, the most recurring pattern is method invocation, a function is stored as a property of an object, thus becoming what we call a method.</p>

        <h2>Ch15: Modern JavaScript</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
    <p>JavaScript libraries are collections of reusable code with a single principal use case. Developers don't have to worry about too many features because the libraries provide a lot of standard functionality.</p> 
    <p>As a result, they may easily construct web pages with user interface components, linguistic tools, mathematical calculations, and other features. Depending on the language, a library has a variety of functions, objects, and methods. You can also use them in a project without relying on a specific framework. That is, you can use as few as one or as many JavaScript libraries as you want.</p>
    <p>MVC is a software architecture proposal used to separate the code by its different responsibilities, maintaining different layers that are in charge of doing a very specific task, which offers various benefits.</p>
    <i>Models</i>
    <p>It is the layer where you work with the data, therefore it will contain mechanisms to access the information and also to update its status. We will usually have the data in a database, so in the models, we will have all the functions that will access the tables and make the corresponding selects, updates, inserts, etc.</p>
    <i>Views</i>
    <p>The views, as their name makes us understand, contain the code of our application that will produce the visualization of the user interfaces, that is, the code that will allow us to render the states of our application in HTML. In the views, we only have the HTML and PHP codes that allow us to display the output.</p>
    <i>Controllers</i>
    <p>Contains the code necessary to respond to actions that are requested in the application, such as viewing an item, making a purchase, searching for information, etc.</p>
