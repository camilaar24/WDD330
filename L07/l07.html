    <h2> Ch8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>  
    <hr size="3" color="grey">
        <i>Transform</i>
        <p>If you only want to move an element vertically(transform: translateX(45px);) or horizontally (transform: translateY(-30px);) you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively.

        </p>
        <p>Transforms don’t work on inline elements. Just add display: inline-block; to the span.

        </p>
            <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.

            </p>
            <p>transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);</p>
           <p>As with translate, you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions.: transform: translateX(40px) scale(1.5);</p>
    
    <i>Transitions<i>  
        <hr size="1" color="grey">
    <p>
        The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.
        </p>
        <p>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state: transition-duration: 0.2s;
        </p>
<p>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail: transition-timing-function: ease-out;

</p>
<p>With the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins. Normally a transition begins immediately, so the default is 0. Include the number of milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s) to delay the transition: -webkit-transition-delay: 50ms;
    transition-delay: 50ms;
    </p>
        <i>Animations</i>  
        <hr size="1" color="grey">
        <p>To create an animation, use the @keyframes rule for IE10+ and FF16+. Include @-webkit-keyframes for all WebKit implementations followed by a name of your choosing, which will serve as the identifier for the animation. Then, you can specify your keyframes.</p> 
        
        <p>Propierties:</p>
        <li>animation-name: appearDisappear;</li>
        <li>animation-duration: 300ms;</li>
        <p>animation-timing-function: linear;</p>
        <li>animation-iteration-count: infinite;</li>
        <li>animation-direction: alternate;</li>
        <li>animation-delay: 50ms;</li>
        <li>animation-fill-mode: both;</li>

        <h2> Ch11: Further Functions</h2>  
    <hr size="3" color="grey">

<p>
    The "call()" method can be used to set the value of "this" within a function to an object that is supplied as the first argument.
        </p>
        <p>Example: function sayHello(){
            return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`;
        }        
        </p>
<p>Immediately Called Function Expressions is an anonymous function that is called as soon as it is defined, the function must be converted to an expression:
    (function(){
    })();    
</p>

<p>Init-Time Branching allows functions to work more effectively in the browser and avoids checking functions each time they are called.</p>
<p>A recursive function is one that calls itself until a certain condition is met.</p>
<p>function factorial(n) {
    if (n === 0) {
        return 1;
    } plus {
        returns n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
</p>

<p>If the number is even, divide by two

    If the number is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
    </p>

    <i>Callbacks</i>  
        <hr size="1" color="grey">
        <p>Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-based asynchronous programming. JavaScript executes code sequentially in descending order. However, there are some cases where code is (or should be) executed after something else starts, and also non-sequentially. This is called asynchronous programming.</p>
        <p>Callbacks ensure that a function will not be executed before a task completes, but will be executed just after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from issues and bugs.</p>

        
        <i>Closures</i>  
        <hr size="1" color="grey">
        <p>Closures are widely used in JavaScript, you just have to know how to recognize them within the code and the functionality implications that it has.

        </p>
        <p>Closures are available because the language implements lambdas and higher-order functions, and they are a direct consequence of writing code using lexical scopes. Closure is a confusing concept because its use is "invisible".

            Unlike other concepts such as functions, variables or others. Closures are not always used consciously and directly.
            </p>
