    <h2> Ch14: HTML5 APIs</h2>  
    <hr size="3" color="grey">
        
        <p>Data- attributes, introduced in HTML5, allow you to define custom data associated with DOM elements in a standardized way. Going back to HTML4, the data related to DOM elements were stored in other attributes, such as class, id, or rel, depending on the developer's preferences.

        </p>
        <p>
            The value of the data-* attribute can be any text string. It can contain numbers but the data type is a string. For example, data-age="30" would have the text value 30, which is different from the number 30.
        </p>
            <p>The Geolocation API allows us to find out the user's position, in terms of geographic coordinates of latitude and longitude, as long as they give permission to share that information with the website. It is implemented with the geolocation object, which is a property of the navigator object.
            </p>
            <p>Web Workers allows scripts to be executed in the background, without being interrupted by events produced by user interactions with the interface.</p>
           <p>Background scripts are recommended for tasks that can be expensive, in terms of duration and/or resource consumption since they can run in parallel to other scripts that are being executed on the page.
        </p>

        <p>Canvas, this API provides us with a rectangle on our web page in which we can draw anything we imagine using JavaScript, even providing animation and interactivity. To do this, the API exposes us to a set of methods or functions that we can use to define and create shapes, gradients, paths or apply various transformations.            </p>

       
        <h2> Ch12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>  
        <hr size="3" color="grey">
        <p>A canvas is a screen-resolution-dependent bitmap canvas that can be used to render graphics, game images, or any other such information on the fly. The canvas is a new HTML5 element that allows us to draw graphics with Javascript. It helps us to represent texts, images, graphics of all kinds, rectangles, lines, gradients, and effects dynamically on the screen. Drawing on the canvas is done through the Canvas 2D API. This API contains a multitude of functions with which we can practically draw anything on it.        </p>
        <p>"canvas id="myCanvas" style="width:300px; height:300px">/canvas"</p>
        <p>SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is a web standard for defining vector-based graphics on web pages. Based on XML, the SVG standard provides markup to describe paths, shapes, and text within a viewport. Markup can be embedded directly into HTML for display or saved to an .svg file and inserted like any other image.</p>
        <p>You can write SVG by hand, but more complicated graphics can be designed in vector graphics editors like Illustrator or InkScape and exported to SVG files or code.</p>
        <p>Developers initialize an "svg" graph with the XML namespace and tag like this:</p>
        <p>svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1"</p>
        <p>With a viewport in place, you can add basic graphics, text, and path elements. </p>
        <p><svg
            version="1.1"
            width="100%"
            viewbox="0 0 600 300"
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
         <rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="100" fill="#f7b2c1" />
         <circle cx="240" cy="60" r="50" fill="#c1b2f7" stroke="#b2c1f7" stroke width="15"/>
         <text x="450" ​​y="70" font-size="20" text-anchor="middle">SVG Text is browser readable!</text>
         <g stroke="#b2c1f7"> <!-- g is for group -->
           <path stroke-width="2" d="M10 170 l590 0" />
           <path stroke-width="4" d="M10 190 l590 0" />
           <path stroke-width="6" d="M10 210 l590 0" />
         </g>
       </svg> </p>
